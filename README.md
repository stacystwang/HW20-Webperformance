# Advanced Web Prototyping Homework

### Background

Now that you've learned a bit about web performance and you're starting to feel familiar with the kinds of interactions you can design for, we're going to do something a little different.

You won't always get to design something from scratch, and you can't always exercise full control over a design. Sometimes you have practical constraints or business constraints, and you're faced with a problem where a full redesign from the ground up isn't possible.

You'll have to work with what you have, make specific decisions about what can be improved, and -- ideally -- even give some insight into the kind of work the development team would need to do. You'll be presented with a problem statement in an imaginary scenario and have to make some choices about how to find a solution.

### Problem Statement

VasPapi is a large web hosting company that is a popular destination for small businesses who need to host a website. After doing some analysis, they discovered that thousands of their customers have some things in common:

* A catalog of products
* An order form where customers manually enter their order and the form triggers an email to the owner
* Low to no usage of that order form
* Poor page load time
* High bounce rates (people leaving before doing anything useful)

VasPapi is considering offering a product where sites fitting these criteria will automatically be updated to an interactive shop interface. However, before they even start development, they want:

* A report on performance and design problems for current sites
* A plan for incremental changes that could be made to improve the existing sites
* An example design that leverages existing content on a site, but provides a better user experience and an interactive shop interface

To this end, they have identified a representative customer -- Lakeside Bike Shop -- whose site reflects the kind of content and design many of their small business customers use. This can be found in the `lakesidebikeshop` folder.

### Report on Performance and Design Problems

 Open `lakesidebikeshop/index.html`. You'll notice many things you want to change right away, but make sure to use the tools you've developed this week and compile objective suggestions to improve the site (both in performance and layout).

 This report should include the following:

* Causes of performance issues
* Possible explanations for high bounce rates (customers leaving site quickly)
* Suggestions for how to fix this without changing the core content of the site (i.e. you can change how a picture is displayed, but you must still use the picture)

### Incremental Changes

Keep in mind that this isn't simply a one-site redesign, but a prototype for how a set of changes might work on a number of sites that are similar but not identical to Lakeside Bike Shop's.

Add to your report some of the following:

* Small changes that could be made to improve the site before even adding the interactive shop
* Types of content on this site that other small business sites might also be using
* Possible stylesheet changes that could be applied across a number of websites to make an improvement

### BONUS: Example Design for a Shop Interface

You've finished the report that VasPapi asked for, so now you can start designing the actual interface for the interactive shop. Go through the design processes you've worked through so far, but apply them to this problem. You're trying to design something that could be applied to similar use cases, but different users.

Before you make any prototypes, it might be helpful to answer the following questions:

* Who are the users of the redesigned websites?
* Who are the users of the _product that automatically redesigns those websites_?
* What questions would you like to ask the owners of Lakeside Bike Shop?
* What changes would be easy to apply accross a wide variety of small business sites?
* What changes would be possible if we were only working on one site, but are impractical when thinking about applying the same philosophy to many sites?
